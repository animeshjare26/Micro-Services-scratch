 * FILE: CorrelationIdFilter.java
 * MODULE: api-gateway (Distributed Tracing Filter)
 * <p>
 * WHAT IS A CORRELATION ID AND WHY DO WE NEED IT?
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * In a monolith, debugging is easy: all logs are in one file on one server.
 * In microservices, a single user action (e.g. clicking "Place Order") triggers a chain
 * of calls across multiple independent servers:
 * <p>
 * User Click
 * │
 * ▼
 * [API Gateway] ──► [Order Service] ──► [Inventory Service] ──► [Payment Service]
 * <p>
 * At peak traffic, servers generate MILLIONS of log lines every minute.
 * If an order fails with a generic "500 Internal Server Error", searching by timestamp
 * is useless because thousands of requests happen in the exact same millisecond.
 * Finding which log line in Payment Service belongs to user #123 is like finding a
 * needle in a haystack.
 * <p>
 * HOW DOES THIS FILTER SOLVE THE PROBLEM?
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. GENERATE OR PRESERVE A UNIQUE ID:
 * When a request hits the Gateway, this filter checks for an `X-Correlation-Id` header.
 * If missing, it generates a fresh UUID (e.g., `abc-123`).
 * <p>
 * 2. PASS DOWNSTREAM TO ALL MICROSERVICES:
 * It injects `X-Correlation-Id: abc-123` into the HTTP request headers sent to downstream
 * services (user-service, product-service, order-service, etc.).
 * Every downstream service logs this ID alongside every log statement.
 * <p>
 * 3. ECHO BACK TO CLIENT IN HTTP RESPONSE:
 * It attaches `X-Correlation-Id: abc-123` to the response header sent back to the browser/app.
 * <p>
 * REAL-WORLD BENEFITS:
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A) ONE-QUERY DISTRIBUTED DEBUGGING:
 * In log aggregators (ELK, Splunk, Grafana Loki, CloudWatch), you simply query:
 * correlationId = "abc-123"
 * You immediately see the entire sequential journey of that specific request:
 * [Gateway]           INFO: Ingress POST /api/orders [X-Correlation-Id: abc-123]
 * [Order-Service]     INFO: Creating order #5002 [X-Correlation-Id: abc-123]
 * [Inventory-Service] INFO: Reserved stock for SKU-LAPTOP [X-Correlation-Id: abc-123]
 * [Payment-Service]   ERROR: Card declined: Insufficient funds [X-Correlation-Id: abc-123]
 * [Order-Service]     WARN: Rolling back order #5002 [X-Correlation-Id: abc-123]
 * Root cause discovered in 10 seconds!
 * <p>
 * B) INSTANT CUSTOMER SUPPORT:
 * If an error occurs, the frontend displays: "Something went wrong. Ref ID: abc-123".
 * The customer gives that ID to support, and developers find the exact error instantly.
 * <p>
 * EXECUTION ORDER:
 * - Runs with `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE` (first filter) so every subsequent filter
 * and log statement has access to this correlation ID.
 * <p>
 * READING ORDER:
 * - Read PREVIOUS: filter/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java
 * - Read THIS FILE: Understand distributed tracing mechanics.
 * - Read NEXT: config/CorsConfig.java
 * <p>
 * TRICKY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ARCHITECTURAL WISDOM:
 * Q1: Senior Question: Why is a Correlation ID essential in a microservices ecosystem?
 * A1: Without a correlation ID, debugging a failed user checkout is impossible.
 * A single click on "Place Order" spans multiple microservices (`Gateway` -> `Order` -> `Inventory` -> `Payment`).
 * Searching through millions of log lines across separate servers is needle-in-a-haystack work.
 * By tagging all log statements with `X-Correlation-Id`, engineers can query log aggregators
 * with `correlationId="abc-123"` and view the exact end-to-end distributed story in sequential order!
 * <p>
 * Q2: Intermediate Question: Why do we also write `X-Correlation-Id` back to the HTTP response header?
 * A2: Client-side observability! When a customer encounters an error ("Something went wrong"),
 * the frontend displays: *"Error Reference: abc-123"*. When the user contacts customer support,
 * the support team looks up that reference ID in the server logs to instantly identify the root cause!
 * <p>
 * Q3: Beginner Intern Question: What is the difference between a `TraceId` and a `CorrelationId`?
 * A3: In OpenTelemetry / Micrometer Tracing, a `TraceId` identifies the entire end-to-end journey,
 * and `SpanId` identifies an individual unit of work within one microservice.
 * A `CorrelationId` is a lightweight, human-readable HTTP header equivalent that accomplishes
 * the same cross-service log linking without requiring a complex tracing backend like Zipkin!
